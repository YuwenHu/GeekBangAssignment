1. use less loops for having less space occupying and time causing.
2. three things to do first in the morning. workout, resolve one leetcode question, TOFEL words(for now, if i finished TOFEL words will switch into GRE)
3. when thinking about how one coding works, notice that paras are changing all the time. do not mess the new para and the old one up . just be careful...
4. remember more/ use more func, will make the coding faster. such as arrayCopy(arr1, 2, arr2, 5, 10), it means copy 10 elements in array 1 start from the second element into array 2 at 5th element's place).
5. please debug when run into problems which could cause you huge time.
6. do not just remember the coding please please..., you will forget them in a short time. understand the solution should be the first place.
