1. use less loops for having less space occupying and time causing.
2. three things to do first in the morning. workout, resolve one leetcode question, TOFEL words(for now, if i finished TOFEL words will switch into GRE)
3. when thinking about how one coding works, notice that paras are changing all the time. do not mess the new para and the old one up . just be careful...
4. remember more/ use more func, will make the coding faster. such as arrayCopy(arr1, 2, arr2, 5, 10), it means copy 10 elements in array 1 start from the second element into array 2 at 5th element's place).
5. please debug when run into problems which could cause you huge time.
6. do not just remember the coding please please..., you will forget them in a short time. understand the solution should be the first place.

Week one note:
  keep doing one problem per day.
  "outliers"1 chunck it up, 2 deliberate practicing, 3 feedback (initative, passive)
  data:
    first-dimensional data: 
      basic: 数组 array, 链表 linked list
      advanced: (堆)栈队列 stack queue (first in last out), 双端队列 deque (first in first out), 集合 set, 映射 map (hash, map)
    second-dimensional data:
      basic: 树 tree, 图 graph
      advanced: （特殊判断+约定条件）二叉树搜索 binary search tree (red-black tree, AVL), 堆 heap, 并查集 disjoint set, 字典树 trie
    particular data: 
      位运算 bitwise, 布隆过滤器 bloomfilter
      缓存 LRU cache
  algorithm:
    basic:
      p1: branch --> if-else, switch
      p2: iteration --> for, which, while loop
      p3: 递归 recursion (drive & conquer, backtrace)
     advanced:
      p1: 搜索 search: 深度优先 depth first search, 广度优先 breadth first search, A*
      p2: 动态规划 dynamic programming
      p3: 二分查找 binary search
      p4: 贪心算法 greedy, 排序 sort
      p5: 数学 math, 几何 geometry
  11：28 算法脑图图片，使用mindnote （Assign：绘制自己的脑图）
  feedback: learn from others (iniactive) github, leetcode, live; let p use your app or give you feedback after read your code
